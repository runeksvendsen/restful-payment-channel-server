  title: RESTful Bitcoin Payment Channel Protocol (v2)
  description: |
    A Bitcoin payment channel enables sending bitcoins between two parties instantly, securely and without fees. The intended use is consumer-to-merchant payments, allowing a consumer to make many small payments to a merchant - with whom the consumer has an open payment channel - while only paying the Bitcoin transaction fee once, when the channel is closed. 
    
    An arbitrary number of payments can be made over the course of, say, one week, and at the end of this week the settlement transaction is published, thus reducing the Bitcoin transaction fee to something that has to be paid every week, rather every time a transaction is made.
    
    The payment server speaking this protocol is the recipient of value, and is operated on behalf of a content delivery server who wishes to receive multiple payments from the same customer/client. The content delivery server passes requests, supplied by the client (payer), to the payment channel server, and delivers content to the client based on the response from the server. 
    
    * Server implementation (**v2** not fully implemented): https://github.com/runeksvendsen/restful-payment-channel-server
    
    * JavaScript client library (**v2** not implemented at all): https://github.com/runeksvendsen/paychanjs-client
    
    **Changes from v1 to v2**:
    
    The main change is that the server is now able to free value it has received over a payment channel without closing it. **1** and **2** cover the changes required for this to work.
    
      1. The client change address (in the payment transaction) is now set to be the channel funding address. If the client wishes to close the channel early it will, at this point, provide a new payment (of zero value) with the desired change address. Reason: the client needs to contact the server in order to close the payment channel anyway. When doing this, it might as well supply a payment that uses the desired change address, hereby enabling the server to redeem the value it has received over the payment channel, without closing it (see **2**). It also gives the client the flexibility to decide which change address to use when it actually needs it, rather than when the channel is opened.
      
      2. The source of funding for the payment transaction is now no longer static. When the server needs to free the value it has received over the channel, it will publish the settlement transaction, and for a temporary period the client will need to make payment on two endpoints, in order to pay the server. In this interim period, the client will receive a 317 response code with the location of the second resource in the *Location* header, and will make a payment on that resource as well. When the Blockchain move is done, the client will then receive a 318 response code, pointing to the same *Location*, indicating that all future payments should be made on that resource. 317 and 318 are the same as the 307 and 308 response codes, respectively, except that the request body needs to be updated to fit the new resource.  
      
      3. A payment (**PaymentData**) now contains all the information over which the client signature is made (previous outpoint, redeem script, sighash flag, etc.). This makes the payment verifiable by itself, as long as the redeem script at the given outpoint in the UTXO set matches, and the channel hasn't expired yet.
      
      4. The client is no longer required to do Blockchain lookup, as long as it knows how much value was sent to the channel funding address. Querying the **/funding/:pubkey/:exp_time/begin_open** endpoint will direct the client to the proper resource, by the server doing the necessary Blockchain lookup. The rationale here is that, as long as the client doesn't have multiple open payment channel with the same public key, it loses nothing by trusting the server with regards to which funding outpoint to use. The worst thing that can happen, from the client's perspective, is that the payment is invalid and the client gets off not paying anything. This also greatly simplifies the case where the server needs to free received value - in which case the client needs to make two payments, using the old and new source of funding - by allowing the server to direct the client to the funding outpoint(s) it needs to use.

      description: |
        Before opening a payment channel with the server, the client must first acquire the server public key, in order to calculate a funding address for the channel.
      
        The client will first calculate the funding address, confirm that it matches the server's, then pay to the funding address, and wait until the funding transaction has the server-specified number of confirmations ("funding_tx_min_conf").
        
        After this, the client will create a new payment of value equal to the server-specified (**'open_price'**), and POST this to the channel URI (see **/begin_open**) in order to open the channel.

        To pay the server, the client will create a new **PaymentData** object with the source of funding set to the outpoint specified by the *'funding_txid'* and *'funding_vout'* parameters. The client change amount is decremented by the desired payment amount, and the change address is set to the channel funding address (in order to allow the server to free the received funds without involvement from the client). Only 'change_value' and 'signature_data' change for new payments. Except in case of the payment needed to prematurely close the channel, in which the client updates 'change_address' to its desired withdrawal address.
