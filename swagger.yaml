  title: RESTful Bitcoin Payment Channel Protocol (v2)
  description: |
    A Bitcoin payment channel enables sending bitcoins between two parties instantly, securely and without fees. The intended use is consumer-to-merchant payments, allowing a consumer to make many small payments to a merchant - with whom the consumer has an open payment channel - while only paying the Bitcoin transaction fee once, when the channel is closed. 
    
    An arbitrary number of payments can be made over the course of, say, one week, and at the end of this week the settlement transaction is published, thus reducing the Bitcoin transaction fee to something that has to be paid every week, rather every time a transaction is made.
    
    The payment server speaking this protocol is the recipient of value. Arbitrary application data can be included with the payment by the client, and returned in response to a payment by the server.
    
    * Server implementation (in progress): https://github.com/runeksvendsen/restful-payment-channel-server
    
    * JavaScript client library (in progress): https://github.com/runeksvendsen/paychanjs-client
    
    Advantages over *bitcoinj* payment channel protocol:
    * Communication via RESTful HTTP requests rather than a stateful TCP connection
      * Works from the browser
      * Easy-to-add encryption (HTTPS)
      * Easier to implement (no connection state)
    * Safe from transaction ID malleability as it uses CLTV (BIP 65), rather than a chain of unconfirmed multisig transactions (the  *bitcoinj* CLTV implementation ("v2") is non-functional: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1250)
    * Increased denial-of-service resistance:
      * The server doesn't need to sign a refund transaction before the client has proven that it has actually funded the channel and paid the server
      * A secret, known only to the client and server, is used in order to prevent attackers from mimicking legimitate client requests
    * The client change address, in the payment transaction, is equal to the channel funding address, allowing the server to free received value while keeping the channel open (the server responds to a payment with an HTTP redirect pointing to the new in-blockchain resource, in case the funding output has moved) (NB: requires either transaction ID malleability fix or waiting for confirmations)
    * Variable, server-defined:
      * Dust limit 
      * Initial payment value (*open_price*)
      * "Settlement period": the server reserves the right to close the channel this many hours *before* the client refund transaction becomes valid.

      summary: Retrieve information about how to fund a new payment channel
      description: |
        Before opening a payment channel with the server, the client must first acquire the server public key, in order to calculate a funding address for the channel.
      
        The client will first calculate the funding address, confirm that it matches the server's, then pay to the funding address, and wait until the funding transaction has the server-specified number of confirmations (**funding_tx_min_conf**).
        
        After this, the client will create a new payment of value equal to the server-specified (**open_price**), and POST this payment to the channel URI to open the channel. Further payments are made though a PUT request on the same URI.

        To pay the server, the client will create a new **PaymentData** object with the source of funding set to the outpoint specified by the *'funding_txid'* and **funding_vout** parameters. The client change amount is decremented by the desired payment amount, and the change address is set to the channel funding address (in order to allow the server to free the received funds without involvement from the client). Only 'change_value' and 'signature_data' change for new payments.

A 404 response should be returned in case the server receives a request with an incorrect client secret, but with otherwise correct data. Also, the server software should be designed in such a way that no difference in response time can be measured between a "genuine" 404 response, and a 404 response that results only from an incorrect secret.
